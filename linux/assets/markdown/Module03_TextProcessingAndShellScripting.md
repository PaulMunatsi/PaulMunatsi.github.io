# Module 3: Text Processing & Shell Scripting

## Overview

Text processing is at the heart of Linux system administration. Configuration files, logs, data filesâ€”everything is text. Mastering text processing tools and shell scripting allows you to automate repetitive tasks, analyze data, and build powerful solutions from simple components.

This module is divided into two weeks:
- **Week 4:** Text processing tools and regular expressions
- **Week 5:** Shell scripting from basics to advanced techniques

By the end of this module, you'll be able to manipulate text files with surgical precision, extract meaningful information from logs, and write scripts that automate complex workflows.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Essential text tools for counting, sorting, and filtering
- sed for stream editing and text transformation
- awk for pattern matching and text processing
- Regular expressions for powerful pattern matching
- Bash scripting fundamentals (variables, input/output)
- Control structures (if/elif/else, loops)
- Functions and code organization
- Arrays and data structures
- Error handling and debugging
- Best practices for production scripts

**Why This Matters:**
- Automation saves time and reduces errors
- Text processing is fundamental to data analysis
- Scripts make complex tasks repeatable
- Every sysadmin needs scripting skills
- These tools are universal across Unix-like systems

### Day 18: Conditionals and Loops

Conditionals and loops are the building blocks of script logic. They allow your scripts to make decisions and repeat actions.

#### If Statements

```bash
# ===== BASIC IF SYNTAX =====

#!/bin/bash
# if statement structure:
# if [ condition ]; then
#     commands
# fi

# Simple if statement
if [ "$1" == "hello" ]; then
    echo "Hi there!"
fi
# Tests if first argument equals "hello"
# [ ] are the test command
# Spaces around brackets are REQUIRED!

# ===== IF-ELSE =====

if [ "$1" == "hello" ]; then
    echo "Hi there!"
else
    echo "Say hello!"
fi
# Executes one block or the other

# ===== IF-ELIF-ELSE =====

if [ "$1" == "hello" ]; then
    echo "Hi there!"
elif [ "$1" == "bye" ]; then
    echo "Goodbye!"
elif [ "$1" == "help" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 {hello|bye|help}"
else
    echo "Unknown command"
fi
# Multiple conditions checked in order
# First match executes, rest skipped

# ===== NUMERIC COMPARISONS =====

AGE=25

if [ $AGE -eq 25 ]; then
    echo "Age is exactly 25"
fi
# Numeric comparison operators:
# -eq : equal to
# -ne : not equal to
# -gt : greater than
# -lt : less than
# -ge : greater than or equal
# -le : less than or equal

# Examples:
if [ $AGE -gt 18 ]; then
    echo "Adult"
fi

if [ $AGE -ge 21 ]; then
    echo "Can drink (US)"
fi

if [ $AGE -lt 65 ]; then
    echo "Working age"
fi

# Range check
if [ $AGE -gt 18 ] && [ $AGE -lt 65 ]; then
    echo "Working age adult"
fi
# && means AND (both conditions must be true)

# ===== STRING COMPARISONS =====

NAME="John"

# Equality
if [ "$NAME" == "John" ]; then
    echo "Hello John"
fi
# Note: ALWAYS quote variables in comparisons!
# Prevents errors if variable is empty

# Inequality
if [ "$NAME" != "Admin" ]; then
    echo "Not admin user"
fi

# String length checks
if [ -z "$NAME" ]; then
    echo "String is empty"
fi
# -z tests for zero length

if [ -n "$NAME" ]; then
    echo "String is not empty"
fi
# -n tests for non-zero length

# ===== FILE TESTS =====

FILE="test.txt"

# File exists
if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
fi
# -f tests for regular file

# Directory exists
if [ -d "/tmp" ]; then
    echo "Directory exists"
fi
# -d tests for directory

# File is readable
if [ -r "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "File is readable"
fi

# File is writable
if [ -w "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "File is writable"
fi

# File is executable
if [ -x "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "File is executable"
fi

# File is not empty
if [ -s "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "File has content"
fi
# -s tests for non-zero size

# File exists (any type)
if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "Path exists"
fi
# -e tests for existence

# Symbolic link
if [ -L "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "Is a symbolic link"
fi

# File is newer than another
if [ "$FILE1" -nt "$FILE2" ]; then
    echo "FILE1 is newer"
fi

# File is older than another
if [ "$FILE1" -ot "$FILE2" ]; then
    echo "FILE1 is older"
fi

# ===== LOGICAL OPERATORS =====

# AND operator (&&)
if [ $AGE -gt 18 ] && [ $AGE -lt 65 ]; then
    echo "Working age"
fi
# Both conditions must be true

# OR operator (||)
if [ $AGE -lt 18 ] || [ $AGE -gt 65 ]; then
    echo "Not working age"
fi
# At least one condition must be true

# NOT operator (!)
if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "File does not exist"
fi
# Inverts the test

# ===== MODERN TEST SYNTAX [[ ]] =====

# Double brackets offer more features
if [[ $AGE -gt 18 && $AGE -lt 65 ]]; then
    echo "Working age"
fi
# Can use && and || inside [[ ]]
# No need for separate [ ] blocks

# Pattern matching with [[ ]]
if [[ "$FILE" == *.txt ]]; then
    echo "Text file"
fi
# Supports wildcards

# Regex matching
if [[ "$EMAIL" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-z]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Valid email format"
fi
# =~ is regex match operator

# ===== PRACTICAL EXAMPLES =====

#!/bin/bash
# Check if script has arguments
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 filename"
    exit 1
fi

FILE=$1

# Validate file exists and is readable
if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$FILE' does not exist"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -r "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$FILE' is not readable"
    exit 1
fi

# File is valid, process it
echo "Processing $FILE..."
# ... rest of script

# ===== CASE STATEMENTS (Better for Multiple Values) =====

#!/bin/bash
# Case statement is cleaner for multiple conditions

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo "Starting service..."
        # start commands here
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Stopping service..."
        # stop commands here
        ;;
    restart)
        echo "Restarting service..."
        # restart commands here
        ;;
    status)
        echo "Checking status..."
        # status commands here
        ;;
    *)
        # Default case (no match)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|status}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

# Case with patterns
case "$FILE" in
    *.txt)
        echo "Text file"
        ;;
    *.jpg|*.png|*.gif)
        echo "Image file"
        ;;
    *.sh)
        echo "Shell script"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown file type"
        ;;
esac
```

#### For Loops

```bash
# ===== BASIC FOR LOOP =====

# Loop over list
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
# Iterates over each item in list

# Loop over words
for word in Hello World From Bash; do
    echo "Word: $word"
done

# Loop over range
for i in {1..10}; do
    echo "Count: $i"
done
# {1..10} expands to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

# Range with step
for i in {0..20..2}; do
    echo $i
done
# Counts 0, 2, 4, 6, ... 20
# {start..end..step}

# ===== LOOPING OVER FILES =====

# Loop through files in directory
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
    # Do something with each file
done

# Loop through files recursively
for file in **/*.txt; do
    echo "Found: $file"
done
# Requires: shopt -s globstar

# ===== C-STYLE FOR LOOP =====

# Traditional for loop syntax
for ((i=1; i<=10; i++)); do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
# Familiar to C/Java programmers
# ((expression)) for arithmetic

# Count down
for ((i=10; i>=1; i--)); do
    echo "Countdown: $i"
done

# Custom increment
for ((i=0; i<=100; i+=10)); do
    echo $i
done
# 0, 10, 20, 30, ... 100

# ===== LOOPING OVER COMMAND OUTPUT =====

# Loop over lines from command
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
    echo "User: $user"
done

# Better: using while read (handles spaces)
while IFS=: read -r username rest; do
    echo "User: $username"
done < /etc/passwd
# More robust than for loop over $(...)

# ===== PRACTICAL EXAMPLES =====

# Batch rename files
for file in *.txt; do
    # Add .bak extension
    mv "$file" "${file}.bak"
done

# Process log files
for log in /var/log/*.log; do
    if [ -f "$log" ]; then
        echo "Analyzing $log"
        grep "ERROR" "$log" | wc -l
    fi
done

# Create multiple directories
for month in Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec; do
    mkdir -p "2024_$month"
done

# Ping multiple servers
for server in server1 server2 server3; do
    if ping -c 1 "$server" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "$server is up"
    else
        echo "$server is down"
    fi
done
```

#### While Loops

```bash
# ===== BASIC WHILE LOOP =====

# Loop while condition is true
COUNT=1
while [ $COUNT -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $COUNT"
    ((COUNT++))
done
# Executes while condition is true

# Infinite loop
while true; do
    echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop"
    sleep 1
done
# Runs forever until interrupted

# ===== READING FILES LINE BY LINE =====

# Best way to read file line by line
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < file.txt
# IFS= preserves leading/trailing whitespace
# -r prevents backslash interpretation

# Read and process
while read -r username uid rest; do
    if [ $uid -ge 1000 ]; then
        echo "Regular user: $username (UID: $uid)"
    fi
done < <(cut -d: -f1,3,4 /etc/passwd | tr ':' ' ')
# Process substitution with <(...)

# ===== UNTIL LOOP (Opposite of While) =====

# Loop until condition is true
COUNT=1
until [ $COUNT -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $COUNT"
    ((COUNT++))
done
# Executes while condition is FALSE
# Stops when condition becomes TRUE

# Wait for file to exist
until [ -f "/tmp/done.txt" ]; do
    echo "Waiting for file..."
    sleep 5
done
echo "File found!"

# ===== LOOP CONTROL =====

# Break - exit loop immediately
for i in {1..10}; do
    if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
        break
    fi
    echo $i
done
# Prints 1-4, then exits loop

# Continue - skip to next iteration
for i in {1..10}; do
    if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
        continue
    fi
    echo $i
done
# Prints 1-4, 6-10 (skips 5)

# ===== PRACTICAL EXAMPLES =====

# Monitor process
while pgrep firefox > /dev/null; do
    echo "Firefox is running..."
    sleep 5
done
echo "Firefox has stopped"

# Retry connection
ATTEMPTS=0
MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
while [ $ATTEMPTS -lt $MAX_ATTEMPTS ]; do
    if ping -c 1 server.com &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Connected!"
        break
    fi
    ((ATTEMPTS++))
    echo "Attempt $ATTEMPTS failed, retrying..."
    sleep 2
done

if [ $ATTEMPTS -eq $MAX_ATTEMPTS ]; then
    echo "Failed to connect after $MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts"
    exit 1
fi

# Process files until none remain
while [ -n "$(ls -A queue/)" ]; do
    for file in queue/*; do
        echo "Processing $file"
        # Process file
        rm "$file"
    done
    sleep 1
done
```

#### Select Menus

```bash
# ===== INTERACTIVE MENU =====

# select creates numbered menu
select option in "List Files" "Show Date" "Show Disk Usage" "Exit"; do
    case $option in
        "List Files")
            ls -l
            ;;
        "Show Date")
            date
            ;;
        "Show Disk Usage")
            df -h
            ;;
        "Exit")
            break
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid option"
            ;;
    esac
done

# Custom prompt
PS3="Choose an option: "
select choice in Option1 Option2 Option3 Quit; do
    case $choice in
        Option1)
            echo "You chose Option 1"
            ;;
        Option2)
            echo "You chose Option 2"
            ;;
        Option3)
            echo "You chose Option 3"
            ;;
        Quit)
            break
            ;;
    esac
done
```

#### Exercise 3.6: Control Structures Practice

**Objective:** Master conditionals and loops in bash scripts.

1. **File Checker Script:**
   - Takes filename as argument
   - Checks if file exists
   - If exists: displays size, line count, permissions
   - If doesn't exist: offers to create it

2. **Number Analyzer:**
   - Loop through numbers 1-20
   - Print "even" or "odd" for each
   - Count total evens and odds
   - Display summary at end

3. **Countdown Timer:**
   - Takes number of seconds as argument
   - Counts down displaying remaining time
   - Shows "Time's up!" when done

4. **Log File Processor:**
   - Loop through all `.log` files in directory
   - For each file: count ERROR, WARNING, INFO lines
   - Generate summary report

5. **Service Controller:**
   - Menu with options: start, stop, restart, status
   - Simulate service control
   - Loop until user chooses exit

**Expected Results:**
- Comfort with if/elif/else statements
- Understanding of for and while loops
- Ability to create interactive scripts
- Experience with loop control (break/continue)

---

#### Challenge 3.6: Number Guessing Game

**Objective:** Create an interactive guessing game.

Build a script that:
1. Generates random number between 1-100
2. Asks user to guess
3. Provides "higher" or "lower" hints
4. Counts number of attempts
5. Offers to play again

**Features:**
- Input validation
- Difficulty levels (easy: 1-10, hard: 1-1000)
- High score tracking
- Hints after 5 wrong guesses

**Sample Output:**
```
=== Number Guessing Game ===
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
Attempt 1: 50
Too low! Try again.
Attempt 2: 75
Too high! Try again.
Attempt 3: 62
Congratulations! You got it in 3 attempts!
Play again? (y/n):
```

### Day 19: Functions and Advanced Scripting

Functions allow you to organize code into reusable blocks, making scripts more maintainable and modular.

#### Functions Basics

```bash
# ===== DEFINING FUNCTIONS =====

# Method 1: function keyword
function greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Method 2: without function keyword (more common)
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Calling function
greet "World"
# Output: Hello, World!

# ===== FUNCTION PARAMETERS =====

# Functions use same parameter variables as scripts
print_info() {
    echo "Function name: ${FUNCNAME}"
    echo "First parameter: $1"
    echo "Second parameter: $2"
    echo "All parameters: $@"
    echo "Parameter count: $#"
}

print_info "arg1" "arg2" "arg3"

# ===== RETURN VALUES =====

# Functions return exit status (0-255)
check_file() {
    if [ -f "$1" ]; then
        return 0  # Success
    else
        return 1  # Failure
    fi
}

# Using return value
if check_file "test.txt"; then
    echo "File exists"
else
    echo "File doesn't exist"
fi

# Return values are limited to 0-255
# For other values, use echo and command substitution

add_numbers() {
    local result=$(($1 + $2))
    echo $result
}

SUM=$(add_numbers 5 3)
echo "Sum: $SUM"

# ===== LOCAL VARIABLES =====

# local makes variables function-scoped
calculate() {
    local result=$(($1 * $2))
    echo $result
}
# result only exists inside function

# Without local, variables are global
global_var="accessible everywhere"

test_scope() {
    local local_var="only in function"
    echo $global_var  # Can access global
    echo $local_var
}

test_scope
echo $global_var    # Works
echo $local_var     # Empty (not in scope)

# ===== PRACTICAL FUNCTION EXAMPLES =====

# Check if command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" &> /dev/null
}

if command_exists docker; then
    echo "Docker is installed"
fi

# Create directory if doesn't exist
ensure_dir() {
    if [ ! -d "$1" ]; then
        mkdir -p "$1"
        echo "Created directory: $1"
    fi
}

ensure_dir "/tmp/myapp"

# Log message with timestamp
log() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $@"
}

log "Starting application"
log "Error occurred"

# Error handling function
die() {
    echo "ERROR: $@" >&2
    exit 1
}

# Usage:
[ -f "$FILE" ] || die "File not found: $FILE"

# Validate email format
validate_email() {
    local email=$1
    if [[ $email =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ ]]; then
        return 0
    else
        return 1
    fi
}

if validate_email "user@example.com"; then
    echo "Valid email"
fi
```

#### Arrays

```bash
# ===== ARRAY BASICS =====

# Declare array
FRUITS=("Apple" "Banana" "Cherry")

# Access elements
echo ${FRUITS[0]}      # Apple (first element)
echo ${FRUITS[1]}      # Banana
echo ${FRUITS[2]}      # Cherry

# All elements
echo ${FRUITS[@]}      # All elements as separate words
echo ${FRUITS[*]}      # All elements as single word

# Array length
echo ${#FRUITS[@]}     # Number of elements

# ===== MODIFYING ARRAYS =====

# Add element
FRUITS+=("Date")
# Or:
FRUITS[3]="Date"

# Remove element (leaves gap)
unset FRUITS[1]

# Reassign element
FRUITS[0]="Apricot"

# ===== LOOPING THROUGH ARRAYS =====

# For loop
for fruit in "${FRUITS[@]}"; do
    echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
# Use "@" and quotes to handle spaces in elements

# For loop with index
for i in "${!FRUITS[@]}"; do
    echo "Index $i: ${FRUITS[$i]}"
done
# ! gives indices

# ===== ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS (Bash 4+) =====

# Declare associative array
declare -A AGES

# Assign values
AGES[john]=30
AGES[jane]=25
AGES[bob]=35

# Access
echo ${AGES[john]}     # 30

# Loop through
for name in "${!AGES[@]}"; do
    echo "$name is ${AGES[$name]} years old"
done

# ===== PRACTICAL ARRAY EXAMPLES =====

# Read file into array
mapfile -t LINES < file.txt
# OR:
readarray -t LINES < file.txt

# Array from command output
FILES=($(ls *.txt))

# Process array
for file in "${FILES[@]}"; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done

# Menu system with array
OPTIONS=("Start" "Stop" "Restart" "Exit")
select choice in "${OPTIONS[@]}"; do
    echo "You chose: $choice"
    break
done
```

#### Error Handling and Debugging

```bash
# ===== EXIT STATUS =====

# Check last command's exit status
ls /nonexistent
echo $?     # Non-zero (failure)

ls /tmp
echo $?     # 0 (success)

# Use in scripts
if some_command; then
    echo "Success"
else
    echo "Failed"
fi

# ===== SET OPTIONS FOR ERROR HANDLING =====

#!/bin/bash
# Strict mode

set -e    # Exit on any error
# Script stops if any command fails

set -u    # Exit on undefined variable
# Prevents typos in variable names

set -o pipefail    # Exit if any command in pipeline fails
# Without this, only last command's status matters

# Combine all three:
set -euo pipefail

# Example with pipefail:
# Without pipefail:
false | true    # Exit status 0 (last command)
# With pipefail:
false | true    # Exit status 1 (first command failed)

# ===== TRAP FOR CLEANUP =====

# trap executes command on signal
cleanup() {
    echo "Cleaning up..."
    rm -f /tmp/tempfile
}

trap cleanup EXIT
# Runs cleanup when script exits

# Create temp file
touch /tmp/tempfile
# Do work...
# cleanup runs automatically

# Trap specific signals
trap 'echo "Interrupted!"; exit 1' INT TERM
# Handles Ctrl+C (INT) and kill (TERM)

# ===== DEBUGGING =====

# Run script with debug output
bash -x script.sh
# Prints each command before executing

# Enable debugging in script
set -x    # Enable
# ... commands to debug
set +x    # Disable

# Custom debug output
DEBUG=true

debug() {
    if [ "$DEBUG" = true ]; then
        echo "DEBUG: $@" >&2
    fi
}

debug "Variable value: $VAR"

# Verbose mode
if [ "$VERBOSE" = true ]; then
    echo "Detailed output..."
fi

# ===== ERROR MESSAGES =====

# Print to stderr
echo "Error: Something went wrong" >&2
# >&2 redirects to standard error

# Error function
error() {
    echo "ERROR: $@" >&2
    exit 1
}

# Usage:
[ -f "$FILE" ] || error "File not found: $FILE"

# Warning function
warn() {
    echo "WARNING: $@" >&2
}

warn "This feature is deprecated"

# ===== DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING =====

# Check arguments
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 file1 file2" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Validate input
if [ -z "$EMAIL" ]; then
    error "Email cannot be empty"
fi

# Check dependencies
for cmd in git docker kubectl; do
    if ! command -v $cmd &> /dev/null; then
        error "Required command not found: $cmd"
    fi
done

# Use default values
OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR:-/tmp/output}
TIMEOUT=${TIMEOUT:-30}

# Validate numeric input
if ! [[ "$AGE" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    error "Age must be a number"
fi
```

#### Advanced Script Patterns

```bash
# ===== SCRIPT TEMPLATE =====

#!/bin/bash
#
# Script: backup.sh
# Description: Backup system files
# Author: Your Name
# Date: 2024-01-15
#
# Usage: ./backup.sh [options] source destination
#

set -euo pipefail  # Strict mode

# ===== CONSTANTS =====
readonly SCRIPT_NAME=$(basename "$0")
readonly SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)
readonly VERSION="1.0.0"

# ===== DEFAULT VALUES =====

#### Exercise 3.7: Functions and Advanced Scripting

**Objective:** Master functions and advanced scripting techniques.

1. **Function Library:**
   - Create functions for common tasks: check file, ensure directory, validate email
   - Save in separate file
   - Source and use in another script

2. **Menu System:**
   - Use functions for each menu option
   - Options: list files, show date, disk usage, exit
   - Use case statement and functions

3. **Array Server Monitor:**
   - Array of server names
   - Function to ping each server
   - Display status for all servers

4. **Error Handling Script:**
   - Implement trap for cleanup
   - Use set -euo pipefail
   - Proper error messages

5. **Configuration Manager:**
   - Read configuration from file
   - Store in associative array
   - Functions to get/set values

---

#### Challenge 3.7: Log Analyzer

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive log analysis tool.

Build a script that:
1. Takes log file as argument
2. Uses functions for each analysis type
3. Counts ERROR, WARNING, INFO messages
4. Finds top 5 most common errors
5. Analyzes activity by hour
6. Saves report with timestamp

**Requirements:**
- Use arrays to store data
- Functions for each analysis
- Error handling and input validation
- Summary report with statistics
- Option to save to file or display

**Sample Output:**
```
=== Log Analysis Report ===
File: /var/log/application.log
Analyzed: 2024-01-15 14:30:00
Lines processed: 10,423

MESSAGE LEVELS:
  ERROR: 145 (1.4%)
  WARNING: 67 (0.6%)
  INFO: 10,211 (98.0%)

TOP 5 ERRORS:
  1. Connection timeout (45 occurrences)
  2. Permission denied (23 occurrences)
  3. File not found (18 occurrences)
  4. Invalid input (12 occurrences)
  5. Memory allocation failed (8 occurrences)

ACTIVITY BY HOUR:
  00:00 - 01:00: 234 messages
  01:00 - 02:00: 198 messages
  ...
